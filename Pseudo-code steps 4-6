STEP 4
Identify the curvature of each point 
Start at one point - find its two neighboring points 
-skip the middle point 
Create an axis that lies on the two other points
Create a parabola that involves the two points 
	f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
	let the axis created be the "new x axis" --> y coordinates now zero, keeping x value
	let the two points on the axis be (p1,0) and (p2,0)
	Set f(p1)=f(p2)=0 
	Solve for a specific c, b and a that give a solution to f(x).
This becomes the parabola that describes the curves between each point 
Create a circle estimated by the parabola to determine if there are points outside that need to
be deleted. 
The circle is best approximated near the vertex V of the parabola 
	If the radius r of the circle is an input given by the user, then the center of the circle
	will be located at the midpoint of the two points on the new x axis and at a y=r 
	(assuming that we are still calling y 0)
		c = ((p1+p2)/2,r)
	If the radius is not given by the user make it 1 
STEP 5
Delete points as necessary 
If points inbetween are on the perimeter of the circle, then keep
If a point(s) are outside the perimeter of the circle then delete them

STEP 6
Fill in the gaps
Where x points are deleted, insert x points on the perimeter of the circle between the last point
kept and the next point kept
