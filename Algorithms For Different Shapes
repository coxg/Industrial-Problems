Take in collection of points 
user inputs how fit they want the shape. 
	- call it a circle for now 
	- estimate a parabola using the circle 
		--let the diameter of the circle be an x axis 
			--- two points on the axis being x1 and x2
			--- f(x)=ax^2+bx+c is the equation used to fit the parabola 
			--- set f(x1)=f(x2)=0 to solve for a b and c and f(x) 
	- the smaller the circle the more fit the shape will be
POLYGON:
Start at p1. Find its next bordering point. 
Between these two points fit the parabola.
keep doing this between each point. 
Make sure the parabola is pointing inward to the shape: test an interior point and see if it
is inside of the bound made by the parabola

LINES: 
Take in the collection of lines, and find their intersections and end points 
The intercetion and end points will be the bordering points
once in order, start at point 1 and find the next bordering point 
Between these two points fit the parabola.
keep doing this between each point. 
Make sure the parabola is pointing inward to the shape: test an interior point and see if it
is inside of the bound made by the parabola

POINTS:
Create edges and lines around and between points
Eliminate the interior lines and keep the points 
Combine lines that are 180 deg of eachother to make one big line
at all other angles the vertex will become a point-- these points will become the border points
Starting at one point, and its neighboring point fit the desired parabola
keep doing this between each point. 
Make sure the parabola is pointing inward to the shape: test an interior point and see if it
is inside of the bound made by the parabola

MIXED:
Figure out if the collection is made up of mostly lines, points or is a polygon
look for any stray points to be included in the shape
follow the steps for whatever the majority is
