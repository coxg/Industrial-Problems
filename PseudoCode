1. Preprocessing

-Limit points to only exterior ones
-Divide points into grid, should be based on diameter of circle

2. Bounding Algorithm

Algorithm 1

-Find bounding box
-Start circle at top corner
-Move circle down 1 pixel (or leave some adjustable granularity)
-Upon collision:
	-Move back 1 pixel
	-Draw circle
	-Change direction slightly

Algorithm 2

-For each point:
	-Find nearest 2 points (one in each direction, perhaps)
	-Attempt to draw circle at point perpendicular to the average of those three points, with distance equal to its radius
	
3. Postprocessing:

-Remove overlapping parts of each circles
